React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components, maintained by [Meta](https://about.meta.com/).

 > React leverages JSX, a combination of JavaScript and HTML syntax, to provide developers with an expressive and efficient way to build component-based UIs. By seamlessly integrating JavaScript logic with HTML-like syntax, React enables the creation of reusable components and facilitates the development of interactive and scalable web applications.
