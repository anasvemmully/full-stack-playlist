Why Bootstrap magical? 🤔

 > Some believe that by simply including the Bootstrap library, all design woes will disappear, and the website will become instantly responsive and visually appealing. However, the reality is that while Bootstrap provides a solid foundation and saves time by offering pre-built components and styles, it still requires customization and understanding of CSS principles to create a truly unique and polished design. It's important to debunk the myth and recognize that Bootstrap is a powerful tool, but it doesn't replace the need for design skills and attention to detail in creating exceptional web experiences.
